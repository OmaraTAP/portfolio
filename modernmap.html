			<p>The following is a modern, much more readable, and up to date version of the map of the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan. As an assignment, my professor had instructed the class that she wanted us to design a map of anything. It could be a make believe world in a book, a game, a country, anything. All she asked for us to do is an extenssive research to make our maps as accurate as possible. Personally I decided I wanted to go back to my roots and make my ancestors proud by recreating a digital map of the gorgeous city they lived in.</p>
