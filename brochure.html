			<p>The project above is a brochure presenting different forms of type on various objects. This assignment directed us to design a brochure with our choices of images presented to us, our choice of color scheme, and our choice on how we decided to decorate each individual box. We had to pretend as if we were designing something important for the Type Directors Club.</p>
