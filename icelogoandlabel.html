			<p>The following images are from a final project that consisted of completely redesigning a drinkâ€™s label and logo. For the logo, I wanted a more direct approach by implementing an image of actual ice. I wanted to keep the text, however, looking color due to the fact that this brand has drinks that come in a variety of colors. For the label I decided that I wanted to keep the class clear background, but  I also wanted to go at a more direct appraoch. Due tot his being a type of soda, I wanted to add some bubbles that float to the top - all the fizz that rizes after opening a new soda bottle. I also wanted to implement another way of showing the type of flavor it is. I added real fruit to float around with the fizz.</p>
